Note: The application should be installed as a system app in order to obtain the right permissions.
Without this functionality will be limited.

## Usage

### Grant restricted permissions: 
On some devices Accessibility and Notification permissions might not be available. To solve this go to:  System Settings > Apps > Smartdock > 3 Dot menu (Top right corner) > Allow restricted permissions

You might also want to hide the Android navigation bar.
[See hiding navigation bar](HideNav.md)

The app uses an accessibility service to capture keyboard input, if that service is crashed you might need to re-enable it and/or restart the system.
